# Uncommon CSS Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in CSS, often leading to unexpected behavior or no visual changes at all.  These are often harder to debug than simple syntax errors. 

**Example Errors:**

*   Invalid property names:  Using hyphens incorrectly, or using non-standard property names.
*   Invalid selectors:  Selectors that don't target any elements on the page.
*   Invalid property values: Using values that aren't valid for the given property.

**How to Solve:**

Carefully check your CSS for typos and ensure that you're using valid property names, selectors, and values.  Using a CSS validator can be helpful in identifying these problems.
